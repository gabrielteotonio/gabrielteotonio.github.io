I am currently Data Engineer at Incognia where I'm working on fraud prevention, location fingerprint, and passwordless authentication.  

Incognia is a US-based sister company to Inloco, and also the name of our anti-fraud solutions in Brazil. Our location technology offers private location awareness for use in mobile applications and connected devices. 30x more precise than GPS, Incognia uses network signals and on-device sensors to build an anonymous location behavioral pattern unique for each user, that provides location context and creates a private identity. Incognia is used by B2B and B2C companies for anonymized location insights, ID verification, authentication, and fraud detection.
